# Task tracker (React)
This is the application I made using React.js for basic manipulation of the UI, and JSON server as a mockup server to store DB.

Application can help you track your task, because it displays them until you chose to delete them by clicking on the X button.Adding is done by clicking the "Add" button, and filing the form.You can set reminder by checking the "Set reminder box" or later by double clicking the desired task. Then you can se left border becoming green.

When you click "Save task", the task is going to be added on the bottom of the list.‚ÄçThe DB on your computer is saved so, when you save the task, DB updates and later, when you visit the same page, all the tasks from DB are rendered.Same goes for the deleting of the task. If you click on "X" Button on the Task Card, that task is going to be deleted in UI and in the DB.
